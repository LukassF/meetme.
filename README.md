## General info
Meetme. is my personal portfolio website, from which all of my other projects, along with the corresponding GitHub repositories can be accessed.
As it often is with portfolio websites, main focus lies on ensuring the user experiences a convenient and stylistically pleasing interface,
thus the exuberance of css and scss files. Anyway enjoy your stay!
